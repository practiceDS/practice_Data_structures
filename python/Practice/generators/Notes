->Generators in Python is defined as the normal function, but used whenever needs to generate value it does this with the help of yeild keyword.
->Generators are useful when we want to store large set of values, but we dont want to store all of them at once.
-> Yeild keyword - returns the value but pause the execution and maintains the initial state of the function.
