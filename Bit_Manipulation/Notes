Concept of Left Shift and Right Shift.
-------------------------------------------------------

-->The left shift and right shift operators should not be used for negative numbers. The result of is undefined behaviour if any of the operands is a negative number. For example results of both -1 << 1 and 1 << -1 is undefined.

-->If the number is shifted more than the size of integer, the behaviour is undefined. For example, 1 << 33 is undefined if integers are stored using 32 bits. For bit shift of larger values 1ULL<<62  ULL is used for Unsigned Long Long which is defined using 64 bits which can store large values.

-->The left-shift by 1 and right-shift by 1 are equivalent to the product of first term and 2 to the power given element(1<<3 = 1*pow(2,3)) and division of first term and second term raised to power 2 (1>>3 = 1/pow(2,3)) respectively. 
As mentioned in point 1, it works only if numbers are positive.
